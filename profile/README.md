## 👋 Welcome

We are **The Plato** — a team obsessed with transforming how humans communicate.

For 50,000 years, spoken communication has remained unchanged while written communication evolved from papyrus to hypertext. We believe the ephemeral nature of verbal conversation is the bottleneck of human intellectual capacity.

**Tiro** is our answer: an AI meeting assistant that captures, processes, and transforms every conversation into lasting value.

## 💭 How We Think

Our decisions are guided by a clear set of principles:

<br>

### 🔬 Pragmatism

> *"An idea's truth is determined by how it works in practice and what difference it makes."*  
> — William James

We judge everything—strategy, product, culture—by one criterion:  
**Does it deliver value to the end user?**

No politics. No theater. Only what works.

<br>

### 🤝 Extreme Trust & Autonomy

> *"Give the best people maximum freedom, and demand the highest responsibility in return."*  
> — Reed Hastings

- Minimal rules, maximum context
- Decisions made at the front line
- Complete transparency in information sharing
- Single-thread ownership

<br>

### 🎯 Small Teams, Giant Impact

> *"Small is not less than."*

We believe a small, elite team achieves more than a large one.

| Team Size | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| 4+ | Effective discussion becomes difficult |
| 8+ | Beyond Amazon's two-pizza rule |
| 15+ | One person can't grasp everything |
| 20+ | Layers become necessary |
| 30+ | Politics emerge structurally |

**Our target: 8-15 people who don't need explanations to understand each other.**

<br>

### ⚗️ Alchemy > Logic

> *"It doesn't pay to be logical if everyone else is being logical."*  
> — Rory Sutherland

- Hands-on experience trumps theoretical reasoning
- Discovery (interpretation) : Invention (intuition) = 4 : 6
- You can be both rational and wrong
- The doer wins by doing, not convincing

<br>

### 😊 Happiness as Practice

> *"Happiness is not a state but an activity—the soul's exercise of virtue."*  
> — Aristotle

We create a workplace where:
- Positive emotions flourish
- Deep focus is possible
- Belonging and connection thrive
- Purpose drives action
- Achievement brings fulfillment

**Work should be the most enjoyable part of your day.**
